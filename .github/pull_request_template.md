## Technical Approach
Explain the technical solution implemented in this PR. Include details about the design, algorithms, or C++-specific techniques used (e.g., memory management, templates, concurrency).

- **Changes Made**:
  - List key code changes (e.g., new classes, modified functions, optimizations).
  - Highlight any C++-specific considerations (e.g., use of smart pointers, STL, or multithreading).
- **Why This Approach**:
  - Justify the chosen solution over alternatives.
  - Mention trade-offs, if any (e.g., performance vs. readability).

## Lessons Learned
Document any insights or challenges encountered during development. This could include:
- **Uninitialized Variables**: Identified and resolved issues with uninitialized variables causing undefined behavior (e.g., random values in local variables). Adopted practices like initializing variables at declaration or using tools like Valgrind to detect uninitialized memory access.
- **Buffer Overflow**: Addressed buffer overflow vulnerabilities (e.g., writing beyond array bounds). Implemented bounds checking, used `std::vector` or `std::array` for safer memory management, and tested with tools like AddressSanitizer to catch overflows.
- Unexpected behavior in C++ (e.g., undefined behavior, compiler-specific issues).
- Performance optimizations or debugging techniques.
- Best practices adopted (e.g., RAII, const-correctness).

## Test Report: How Has This Been Tested
The changes were tested through a combination of unit, edge, error, baseline, integration, performance, and manual tests. Testing was conducted locally (e.g., on Ubuntu 22.04 with GCC 12.3) and on CI using Doctest for C++ unit tests and pytest for Python unit tests (if applicable, e.g., for pybind11 bindings). Baseline tests were performed using `testjob.py` to execute standard test scenarios and `analyzejob.py` to validate results against expected metrics. Integration tests with Viva’s payment APIs were performed using build 27.XXX in Viva’s YYY tool (e.g., Demo environment or payment simulator) with specified test recipes, and recipes were executed on tools ZZZ (e.g., CI pipeline or Payconiq’s External Environment). Additional tools like Valgrind for memory checks and Google Benchmark for performance were used. Below are the detailed results:

- **Unit Tests**:
  - List new or modified unit tests using Doctest for C++ code and pytest for Python code (if applicable, e.g., for pybind11 bindings).
  - Example: `test_my_feature.cpp` added with 95% coverage using Doctest assertions; `test_rtcm_op.py` added with pytest for Python interface, covering key functionality.
- **Edge Test Cases**:
  - List specific edge cases tested, such as boundary conditions or extreme inputs.
  - Example: Tested `std::vector` with max size, empty input, or null pointers using Doctest `CHECK` macros; tested Python RTCM operations with empty inputs using pytest in `test_rtcm_op.py`; tested Viva API (build 27.XXX) with maximum transaction amounts or edge-case payment tokens on YYY tool.
  - Confirm behavior for edge cases (e.g., handling `INT_MAX`, zero, or negative values).
- **Error Test Cases (Invalid Inputs)**:
  - List tests for invalid or malformed inputs to ensure robust error handling.
  - Example: Tested function with `nullptr`, invalid file paths, or out-of-range values using Doctest `CHECK_THROWS` or `CHECK_FALSE`; tested invalid Python inputs using pytest `raises` in `test_rtcm_op.py`; tested Viva API (build 27.XXX) with invalid card details or expired tokens on YYY tool, executed via recipes on tools ZZZ.
  - Describe how errors are handled (e.g., exceptions, error codes) and verify expected behavior.
- **Baseline Testing**:
  - List baseline tests performed to establish reference behavior or performance metrics using `testjob.py` and `analyzejob.py`.
  - Example: Ran `testjob.py` to execute baseline test scenarios for RTCM operations (e.g., standard data processing via Python bindings to C++ modules) with predefined inputs; used `analyzejob.py` to parse test outputs, compare against expected metrics (e.g., processing time, data accuracy, system stability), and generate summary reports. Tests were executed locally and on CI using pytest, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.
  - Confirm baseline results align with expected standards (e.g., response times within 10ms, 100% data integrity).
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Describe integration or end-to-end tests, specifying if Doctest, pytest, or Viva testing was used with build 27.XXX.
  - Example: Tested integration with Viva’s payment APIs (build 27.XXX) using test recipes on Viva’s YYY tool (e.g., Smart Checkout in Demo environment for Klarna payments); executed recipes on tools ZZZ (e.g., Payconiq’s External Environment via test app or CI pipeline with custom scripts) to validate transaction processing; used Doctest or pytest for C++ or Python integration points, respectively.
  - Confirm interactions between modules (e.g., C++ backend with Viva APIs or Python front-end with payment services).
- **Performance Test Cases**:
  - List performance tests conducted to validate optimizations or ensure no regressions.
  - Example: Benchmarked `my_function` with 10K, 100K, and 1M iterations using `std::chrono` and verified with Doctest; verified Python RTCM operation performance with pytest in `test_rtcm_op.py`; tested Viva API (build 27.XXX) response times for high-volume transactions on YYY tool, executed via recipes on tools ZZZ.
  - Describe the methodology (e.g., tools used, environment, input sizes).
    - Tools: e.g., Doctest for C++ assertions, pytest for Python assertions, Google Benchmark, Perf, or custom `std::chrono`-based timers; Viva YYY tool and tools ZZZ for payment API testing; `testjob.py` and `analyzejob.py` for baseline testing.
    - Environment: e.g., hardware specs, compiler (GCC/Clang), optimization flags (`-O2`, `-O3`), Python version (e.g., 3.11), Viva build 27.XXX on YYY tool, tools ZZZ.
    - Input Sizes: e.g., small, medium, large datasets to stress the system; multiple transaction volumes for Viva APIs.
  - Results: Quantify improvements or confirm no regressions (e.g., "Reduced runtime by 15% for 1M elements; Viva API latency under 200ms for 100 transactions").
- **Manual Testing**:
  - Steps performed manually to verify the fix or feature.
  - Example: Manually tested Viva payment flow (build 27.XXX) on YYY tool using test card details provided in the Demo environment.
- **Test Results**:
  - Confirm all tests pass (e.g., CI pipeline status with Doctest, pytest, baseline, and Viva test output).
  - Include any relevant metrics (e.g., performance benchmarks, memory usage).
  - Example: `All Doctest, pytest, baseline (via testjob.py and analyzejob.py), and Viva tests (build 27.XXX on YYY tool, recipes on ZZZ) passed on CI. Performance improved by 20% for X scenario. Memory usage reduced by 10MB. Viva API transactions processed successfully.`
